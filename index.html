                <p>Aqua is one of the three main deuteragonists in the KonoSuba series. 
                    Prior to life in the Fantasy World, she was a goddess of water who guided humans to the afterlife; within, 
                    she is worshipped by the Axis Order.

            <p>As a water goddess, Aqua has the power to purify water, 
                from contaminated hot springs to coffee and tea, through mere contact. However, 
                it seems this is something Aqua has no control over as any liquid she touches becomes purified, 
                regardless of intent, while casting Purification simply increases the effect.</p>

            <p>This type of ability enables Aqua to conjure a powerful energy 
                that can be released by either striking the enemy with her staff or with her hands. 
                Like her God Blow, this ability will purify anything it comes in to contact with.</p>
